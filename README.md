This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

My attempt to clone the popular blog site, Medium.
In this I leveraged React, NextJS, and the Sanity framework to fully develop a full-stack application that can retrieve posts as well as get comments from the back end.
